## About me ğŸ‘‹
Here I'm sharing little info about me! And practise using Github ğŸ˜„


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own game project, exploring Unity and C#!

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™ve been recently learning the basics of game development using Unity, including scripting, platform mechanics, and UI design.

- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on future game dev projects once Iâ€™ve polished my skills!

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about.. anything!?
  
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: GitHub profile link or LindedIn ğŸ“®
  
- âš¡ Fun fact: my true love is coffee, say my friends and I agree!
